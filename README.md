# pandas_challenge
A big thank you to Liang and Luna at AskBCS for advising me not to use square brackets when creating data frames with more than one row and for prompting me to check over the names of the data frames when calling them to make sure that they exist and are spelt correctly!
A thank you also to Mushfiqur Rahman from whom I discovered the code to remove the $ symbol from a value before a float conversion could be achieved.
